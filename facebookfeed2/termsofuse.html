        <p><strong>Terms of Use</strong></p>
        <p>Welcome to Challenge!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Challenge and provide information about the Challenge Service, outlined below. When you create a Challenge account or use Challenge, you agree to these terms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Challenge Service</strong></p>
        <p>We agree to provide you with the Challenge Service. The Service includes all of the Challenge products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Challenge&rsquo;s mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.<br />People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Challenge.</li>
            <li>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.<br />We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. Learn more in the Data Policy</a>.</li>
            <li>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.<br />Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community.</li>
            <li>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.<br />To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence.</li>
            <li>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</li>
            <li>Research and innovation.<br />We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Data Policy</strong></p>
        <p>Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and share information across the </a>Challenge Products</a>. It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the </a>Challenge Privacy and Security Settings</a>. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Challenge.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Your Commitments</strong></p>
        <p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Who Can Use Challenge. We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Challenge community.</p>

            <li>You must not be a convicted sex offender.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <p>How We Will Handle Disputes.</p>
        <p>If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim.</p>
        <p>Unsolicited Material.</p>
        <p>We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
